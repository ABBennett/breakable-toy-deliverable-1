# Breakable Toy Ideas

<Your ideas, here>

<Chatroom app with user ratings(faye gem)>

* The central feature for this app would be a chatroom that pushes messages to multiple browsers that are              connected to the same chat. This would entail some AJAX, jquery, and the faye gem.

* fancy features:
    ~ users can rate the other user's conversation skills based upon the chat experience.
    ~ users' ratings get stored to give a user an average ratings
    ~ users can only join chats with other similarly ranked users
    ~ graphs or display of data how a user ranks among other users
    ~ archive of conversations
    ~ different "lobbies" for conversations about different things        



<Voice to text todo list(watson speech to text, twilio)>

* The central feature of this app would be to be able to record speech and save it as text and then hopefully send a text message to a phone number.

* fancy features:
  ~implement watson dialog api to automate conversation through speech
  ~ specify a time for the text to be sent
  ~specify for the reminder to be sent at specific intervals
  ~specify the repeated messages through voice as well

super fancy:
  ~make it a chrome extension with coffeescript? not sure if this can be done
